# MyWebstrates

This is the code repo for MyWebstrates which will be presented at [UIST 2024](https://uist.acm.org/2024/) in Pittsburgh Oct. 13-16 2024. 

MyWebstrates is a reimplementation of [Webstrates](https://webstrates.net) designed to work as [local-first software](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/). Unlike the original Webstrates, which relies on a central server, MyWebstrates makes servers optional, enabling new possibilities like offline work, peer-to-peer collaboration, and greater control over data. It uses [Automerge](https://automerge.org), a local-first CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) library, which offers even more advanced features than Webstrates, such as sophisticated versioning and interoperability with other software. Read more in the research paper below.

MyWebstrates is a collaboration between [Aarhus University](https://au.dk), [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home), [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr), and [Ink & Switch](https://inkandswitch.com).
